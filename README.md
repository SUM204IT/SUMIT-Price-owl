# 🦉 PriceOwl

PriceOwl is a full-stack MERN application that helps users track product prices from Amazon and Flipkart. Simply paste a product URL, and PriceOwl will continuously monitor its price. Whenever the price drops, users automatically receive an email notification with the latest product price.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User creates an account or logs in.
2. User submits an Amazon or Flipkart product URL.
3. Product details and current price are stored in MongoDB.
4. A cron job periodically checks the latest product price.
5. If a price drop is detected:
   - The product data is updated.
   - An email notification is automatically sent to the user.
6. Users stay informed without manually checking prices.
